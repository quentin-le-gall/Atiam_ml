As we have seen previously, we can compute a whole set of features out of audio waveforms. These features were used in the traditional approaches of machine learning, which performed _feature-based learning_. If we look at the space induced by these features, we can clearly see that similar examples are somewhat grouped together.\n",

Formally, given a set of elements $e_{i}$, $i\\in\\left[1,N\\right]$ and their corresponding features $\\mathbf{f_{i,m}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (which denotes the $m^{th}$ feature of the $i^{th}$ element, which can be $d$-dimensional), we will need to compute a distance measure $\\mathcal{D}\\left(\\mathbf{f_{i,m}},\\mathbf{f_{j,m}}\\right)$ between the features of elements of the dataset. This distance will express the dissimilarity between two features. For the first two questions of the tutorial, we will simply consider that the dissimilarity between features is expressed by their Euclidean $(l_{2})$ distance.\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "When proposing machine learning algorithms, the fundamental aspects lies in correctly evaluating their performances. Depending on the application, methods, dataset and even the nature of corresponding data, a plethora of evaluation measures can be used. We highly recommend the following articles for those interested in machine learning, so that you develop your critical mind and do not limit yourself to narrow evaluations (by relying on statistical tests) and also that you avoid **cherry picking**  \n",

    "However, for the scope of this tutorial, we will limit ourselves to typical measures minimally required to evaluate your classifier. Overall, the most important aspects of evaluation lies in different ways of comparing the *real labels* (ground truth) to the *assigned labels* (picked by the classifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **confusion matrix** is computed simply by counting the occurences in which a particular instance of a real label (row) is classified to an assigned label (column). This code is already provided in the starter code, and all the following measures can be derived directly from it.\n",
    "  * The **overall accuracy** is computed as the ratio of correctly classified examples divided by the complete number of examples.\n",
    "  * The (per-class) **precision** defines the ratio of examples correctly assigned to a class divided by the number of instances assigned to that class by the classifier.\n",
    "  * The (per-class) **recall** defines the ratio of examples correctly assigned to a class divided by the number of instances really belonging to that class.\n",
    "  * The **F1 measure** is defined as the ratio between the geometric and harmonic means between the precision and recall measures.\n",
